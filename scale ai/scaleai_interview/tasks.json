The presentation will use powerpoint slides so I want you to create the material that I can transfer over to powerpoint. Separate the content that will go on each slide by a couple of spaces for ease. The slides will need a title slide, objectives and content slides. After the title and objective slides,  I want to stat off with a true or false question asking whether hospice is only for people who are imminently dying and use jimmy carter as an example. I then want to explain what hospice is and is not, who qualifies, and to compare it to palliative care. Explain the members of the hospice team. List the common problems that hospice patients experience such as oropharengeal secreations, dyspnea, pain, constipation, and delirium and agitation, then have each of those problems explained in further detail on their own respective slide that includes the background and common medications and the doses recommended to treat them. Then focus on how pain and dyspnea is treated in hospice patients. Talk about deprescribing in hospice care and which medications are commonly stopped and why. Make a slide talking about whether to keep or stop specialty medications. Finally talk about naloxones use in hospice care and whether it is appropriate or not appropriate to use and why. Create a patient case that includes a mix of what was presented about.",
